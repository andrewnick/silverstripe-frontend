## Changelog

Not released yet.

## Installation 

1. Include the module folder in your project root folder and rename it to "frontend"
1. Flush the manifest (?flush=1)

## Features

- provides an sspagination jQuery UI widget which acts as a drop-in replacement for regular pagination.
- provides an ssendless jQuery UI widget which adds a Twitter-style rollout pagination. 

# Components

## sspagination (jquery.ss.pagination.js)

The widget completely replaces a specified PHP-driven pagination control with a JS one. The original markup is hidden
and not used, and internal underscore templates are used instead. Variety of classes are available on the DOM elements
for customisation. A couple of hooks have also been provided. 

To fetch pages the widget is using a "poor man's PJAX" - which means it fetches the entire page via AJAX, and then uses
jQuery to pick up only the element that needs to be replaced. The upside is we don't need to write any extra PHP
controller handlers, the downside is we are rendering entire page on each request. If you wish to speed it up, detect
the AJAX request and provide just the necessary content snippet.

### Including pagination metadata

The widget relies on the pagination metadata to be supplied during creation. This can be done via normal jQuery UI
option mechanism, but the easiest way to achieve that is to use the `AjaPaginatedList` as a wrapper for the DataList.

```php
public function Pages() {
	return new AjaxPaginatedList(Page::get(), $this->request);
}
```

This provides you with an API call to generate HTML5 data attributes containing the pagination metadata that the widget
can automatically pick up. On the template side add it to the element containing the static pagination control. The
optional attribute is the same as for the `PaginationSummary` - it specifies the amount of context to be shown around
current page.

```html
<ul class="pagination" $Pages.PaginationMetadata(2)>
```

### Applying and configuring the widget

Apply the widget on the frontend by at minimum specifying the `contentSelector` option. This is a selector that will be
used to find the content element to replace, and also to find the relevant piece of the content received via a regular
AJAX call. Also specify the spinner (an indicator) that will automatically be shown when the pages are loading. You
should add this indicator element yourself, and hide it with CSS, so it doesn't appear if JS is broken/disabled.

```js
$('ul.pagination').sspagination({
	contentSelector: '.pagination-content',
	indicatorElement: $('.pagination-indicator')
});
```

The dynamic pagination should now be running.

You can invoke functions on the widget in the usual jQuery UI way:

```js
// This will invoke the page fetch, and refresh the pagination control.
$('ul.pagination').sspagination('setCurrentPage', 2);

// Hook into the sspagination events.
$('ul.pagination').bind('sspaginationafterpagefetch', function(event) {
	// Do processing.
});

// This uses the item number instead (as opposed to the page), which is how the backend handles the pagination.
$('ul.pagination').sspagination({pageStart: 2});

// You can also dynamically change page size and the widget will refresh itself accordingly (this does not invoke a fetch).
$('ul.pagination').sspagination({pageLength: 1});

// Destroy the widget and revert to static navigation.
$('ul.pagination').sspagination('destroy');
```

### Template customisation

The widget DOM is built up from parametrised underscore.js templates. You can redefine them to get a custom layout:

```js
	$('ul.pagination').sspagination({
		templates: {
			abbrev: '<li class="ss-pagination-abbrev my-custom-abbrev-class">â€¦</li>'
		}
	});
```

To see available templates (and the defaults), have a look at the top of the source file.

### Options

* `contentSelector`
* `pageStart`
* `pageLength`
* `totalItems`
* `getParam`
* `context`
* `indicatorElement`

### Methods

* `getTotalPages`
* `getCurrentPage`
* `setCurrentPage`
* `destroy`

### Events

* `beforepagefetch`: before the AJAX call is made. Return false to prevent fetching.
* `afterpagefetch`: after a successful fetch & refresh (i.e. after the relevant afterrefresh)
* `beforerefresh`: before the widget is updated (removed and recreated to fit with the current options). Return false to
prevent refreshing.
* `afterrefresh`: after the widget has been updated.
* `ontransition`: called just before the pagination-content element is about to be manipulated. Return false to prevent
default behaviour.

## ssendless (jquery.ss.endless.js)

This widget extends the sspagination (both js files have to be included). It replaces the classical, skip-to-page,
pagination with a endless rollout behaviour. Instead of removing the displayed page content it appends the consecutive
page at the end, and removes itself from the way if there is no more pages to be displayed.

The behaviour of dynamic changes to options is unspecified with this widget - i.e. it should be preconfigured on
creation.

The widget usage is similar to sspagination:

```js
$('ul.pagination').ssendless({
	contentSelector: '.pagination-content',
	indicatorElement: $('.pagination-indicator')
});
```

Nothing yet.

# Dev notes

* template parametrisation currently works on creation only. This is because setting deeply nested options replaces the
exisiting structures.
